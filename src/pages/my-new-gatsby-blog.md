I am learning Gatsby and React!

As I've ventured further into the backend, I've lost touch with my roots in the frontend. The main component I miss is JavaScript itself. This by far is my favorite language, yet I hardly ever use it these days.

I figure what better way to refresh myself with JavaScript than to start a project. I have tried getting back into JavaScript with courses, but I've found myself less than enthused to pursue the knowledge without a practical way to put it to good use. Thus my new blog is born.

There isn't much here now, but I plan on continuing to build this out, so if you're here while this site looks like hot garbage I apologize haha!

In the meantime, here's a talk I did on "knowing yourself" and how it helps on the journey to becoming a developer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfuDyjGg2r4
